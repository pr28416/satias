    \caption{Sensitivity analysis of IoU and Proximity weight balance in SATIAS. The left plot shows Mean Average Precision (MAP) as a function of IoU weight (with Proximity weight = 1-IoU weight). The right plot shows Precision@k metrics. The optimal performance is achieved with an IoU-weighted balance (IoU: 0.75, Proximity: 0.25), indicating that while both spatial overlap and center proximity are important factors, the degree of overlap (IoU) has slightly more impact on retrieval performance than proximity.}
